# CaptivePortalJS

A ReactJS/ExpressJS powered `captive-portal`

## GOALS

- Convert it to a server with Express
- Create a dynamic interface with React
- Apply all the planned features (see below)
- Create an RPC client that's compitable with [VOT-JS](https://github.com/almapro/vot-js)

## Planned features

- Spoof network connections to show captive-portal interface
- Gather info about connected devices (OS, MAC, Uptime, etc...)
- Use captive-portal interface to install SSL certificates, native apps, PWA
- Hijack network sessions using SSL certificates spoofing
- Spy on vicitms using native apps
- Add tools/services control (start/stop/restart) to the interface
- Logs (lots of them)
- Client side attacks (whatever possible)
- Detect if the victim suspects captive-portal (user-interactions based)
